Project Overview
-----------------
Our project for the ACI course is to design and implement a
system to measure the noise levels in parts of a city
using a Raspberry Pi.

We would like to design a device that is designed to be
installed on lamp posts throughout the city. The devices
will not be connected to a network full time; but will
only be able to connect to the network from time to time,
such as when a vehicle with internet access passes by.

The sound recorded from the microphones on the Pi will be
analyzed (using a very simple algorithm) to generate a
average loudness level, once per minute. These values
will be sent to a cloud server. A web page can be accessed
to show a timeline of noise levels in different points
in the city.

The challenge in this project is that devices only have
intermittent connectivity.

Implementation Plan
---------------------

To overcome the connection problem, we will be using
solutions developed for "delay tolerant networking".
